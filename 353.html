						<p class="text"> ENPH 353 is a 3-year old course mandatory for engineering physics students designed 
							as "a guided, self-directed project course for you to practice some of the most recent techniques 
							and developments in control software and data classification." The course consists of 6 weekly labs 
							to teach the fundamentals of ROS, OpenCV, image thresholding, imitation learning and reinforcement 
							learning in order to give students the skills necessary to complete the main project: the self-driving 
							vehicle competition.</p>
						<p class="text">The goal of the competition is to navigate the track, avoiding pedestrians and other vehicles,
							 while scanning and reading license plates, reporting them to the competition server. My partner Holden 
							 and I collaborated to build an implementation in Linux using both PID control
								and imitation learning to navigate the course. We used image thresholding in OpenCV to isolate license
							   plates and trained a TensorFow neural network to convert the license plate images to text. Our 
							   implementation was one of three teams in the 16 team competition to identify all 8 license plates 
							   correctly, and our robot completed the course 30 seconds faster than the other two teams, winning 
							   the competition. Our final report with details of our implementation is below.</p>
