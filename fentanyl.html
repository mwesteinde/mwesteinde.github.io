						<p>Benchtop system to quantify fentanyl in fluid.</p>
	
						<p class="text"><b>Context: </b> In the 4th and 5th years of the Engineering Physics program at UBC, teams of four students undertake industry-sponsored projects designed to provide hands-on experience tackling ambitious real-world problems.</p>
						
						<p class="text">One such problem is the opioid epidemic, which claims thousands of lives in British Columbia each year due to fentanyl overdoses. Fentanyl is highly addictive, and many individuals will use a drug sample even when they know it contains fentanyl. Therefore, it's crucial to provide a quantitative measure of the amount of fentanyl present in a drug sample. While many inexpensive solutions can detect the presence of fentanyl, few can quantify its concentration.
						
						<p class="text">
							Our project focused on enhancing a novel electrochemical technique developed by Dr. Dan Bizzotto and Dr. Glen Sammis from the UBC Chemistry Department. Their method, although capable of inexpensively quantifying fentanyl concentration, required 8 hours to analyze a single sample and involved a complex laboratory process. Our goal was to reduce the analysis time to 20 minutes and make the process accessible to non-specialists, thereby improving the efficiency of fentanyl detection.</p>

						<p class="text">To achieve this, my team and I designed and built a benchtop prototype. We developed a fluidic system to handle drug samples, passing them through a custom 3D-printed microfluidic flowcell containing an electrode. We then interfaced a potentiostat through serial communication to effect a series of redox reactions to detect fentanyl concentration. Additionally, we created a multithreaded desktop application in Python to control the system, manage data, and analyze results.</p>

						<p class="text">The outcome was a benchtop device that significantly expedited the detection process, allowing Dr. Bizzotto and Dr. Sammis to further refine their detection chemistry. For a detailed technical overview of our work, please refer to our final report below.</p>
