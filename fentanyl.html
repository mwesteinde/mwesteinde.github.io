						<p>Benchtop system to quantify fentanyl in fluid.</p>
	
						<p class="text"><b>Context: </b> In each of the 4th and 5th year of the engineering physics program at UBC, teams of 4 
							take on an industry-sponsored project designed to give students an opportunity to tackle an ambitious 
							real-world problem.</p>
						
						<p class="text">Thousands of British Columbians are dying from fentanyl overdoses a year and the opioid epidemic is showing 
							no signs of slowing down. Since fentanyl is highly addictive, many people wil use a drug sample even if they know it 
							contains fentanyl. It is thus essential to be able to provide a quantitative measure of how much fentanyl is in a drug. 
							Although there are many inexpensive solutions that detect the presence of fentanyl, none quantify its concentration.
						
						<p class="text">Dr. Dan Bizzotto and Dr. Glen Sammis of the UBC Chemistry Department created 
							a novel electrochemistry technique to precisely measure the concentration of fentanyl in street drug samples. However, this technique 
							took 8 hours to analyse a single drug sample and could only be run in a chemistry lab. For our project, my 3 teammates and I built a 
							benchtop prototype to cut this analysis time down to 20 minutes so the detection could be developed much quicker. </p>

						<p class="text">In this project, we built a fluidic system to accept a drug sample and move it through a custom microfluidic 
							flowcell that housed an electrode. In the flowcell, we conducted a series of redox reactions on an electrode to be able to detect the 
							concentration of a fentanyl analogue in the sample. We wrote a multithreaded desktop application that controlled the system, saved and analyzed the results.</p>

						<p class="text">The final result was a working benchtop device to allow for Dr. Bizzotto and Dr. Sammis to continue to refine the 
							detection chemistry. To read more about the technical details of the project see our final report below.</p>
